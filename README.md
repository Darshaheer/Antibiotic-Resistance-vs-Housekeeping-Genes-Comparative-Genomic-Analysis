# Antibiotic-Resistance-vs-Housekeeping-Genes-Comparative-Genomic-Analysis
This project integrates Python and R for sequence analysis. Python extracts sequences, performs multiple alignments, and calculates GC content, while R visualizes GC distribution and nucleotide bias, providing insights into sequence composition and base-level variation across samples.
